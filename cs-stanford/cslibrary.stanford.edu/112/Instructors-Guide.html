Putting the Piece, Board, and Brainsystems all together creates something larger than the typical CS2 assignment,and some of the algorithms are tricky to get right. The complexity makesfor a more convincing demonstration of the benefits of a modular OOP design.From a teaching point of view, the main theme of the assignment is usingOOP decomposition to divide a complex system into more manageable pieces.<p>We require the students to have separate test code for both Piece andBoard before the two are used in the full tetris. Partly this is just anexcuse to teach them about modular test code, and partly because it reallyis the best way to get the whole thing to work. The project is too bigto debug all at once.<p>Engineering issues aside, tetris is at its heart a fun and visuallyengaging project. The brain and adversary features add novelty and furtherways to play with the system. It's the sort of assignment that the studentsplay with for hours after the required functionality has been done. (Unlesstheir Board doesn't quite work -- nothing sucks the fun out of game oftetris quicker than a board that, say, doesn't do row clearing right.)<p>I see tetris being used in a CS2 course or later to show off OOP decompositionon a large project. Programming maturity is required to code and debugthe algorithms. The students probably should get 2 or 3 weeks to completethe project, and it should be due in stages, which fits well with its modulartheme.<h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>The best feature of the assignment is that it attacks some real complexitywith OOP decomposition. It also builds something visual and fun that thestudents really enjoy playing with. The bad part of the assignment is thatit is large, and some of the algorithms are tricky. This can be very frustratingfor the students if they don't have the skills to deal with that scaleof program yet. It also means that it's going to take 2 or 3 weeks outof the term.<h3>Alternative</h3>As an alternative to the full tetris project, the students can just workon their own brain code and load it in to the off-the-shelf JTetris programto try it out. This makes a fun little assignment. Brain code is surprisinglyeasy to write -- it requires only a basic understanding of Java and OOP.The problem itself is creative and open-ended. There is no right answer;intead the students can code up their heuristic ideas pretty easily andsee what they do. The readme has some suggested brain strategies. The LameBrainthat ships with the project is extremely simple -- I found that when Ishipped a better brain, it seemed to inhibit the students from trying theirown. With the LameBrain, it's obvious to the students that they could easilywrite a better one (or perhaps watching it play poorly is just too offensiveto allow to pass without improvement!).<p>Implementation Variants<ul><li>The assignment can be given as a non-OOP ADT assignment. There's not reallyany inheritance going on -- I've given a verison of this assignment inPascal with Piece and Board ADTs.</li><li>The undo algorithm and interface could be simplified without compromisingthe assignment by relaxing the constraint that the Board and its undo systembe so efficient. In particular, implement undo just by copying the wholeboard instead of the efficient/stingy strategy. In this way, the clientcan just copy the board before making changes. This is slower since itcopies more, and in Java, it will tend to introduce memory churn in thealgorithm, where the stingy strategy never calls new after the initialallocation.</li><li>The undo algorithm could work without any copying, but instead by rememberingthe piece and location of the last play, and then backing it out blockby block. Row clearing would have to be handled separately.</li><li>The board could use something other than a 2-d array as its internal representation.I suspect storing each column as a single 32 bit int and using a bit torepresent a block would run faster. Another idea is to store the booleansin a 1-d array and do the offset arithmetic explicitly intead of usinga 2-d array.</li></ul></body></html>
