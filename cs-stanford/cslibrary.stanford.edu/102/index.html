Explains how pointersand memory work and how to use them -- from the basic concepts throughall the major programming techniques. Can be used as an introduction topointers for someone with basic programming experience or as a quick review.Many advanced programming and debugging problems only make sense with asolid understanding of pointers and memory -- this document tries to providethat understanding.<p>Topics include: pointers, local memory, allocation, deallocation, dereferenceoperations, pointer assignment, deep vs. shallow copies, the ampersandoperator (&amp;), bad pointers, the NULL pointer, value parameters, referenceparameters, pointer to pointers, dynamic heap memory, memory ownershipmodels, and memory leaks. The article focuses on pointers and memory incompiled languages like C and C++ with occasional notes about Java.<h3>Download <a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/102/PointersAndMemory.pdf">Pointer</a><a href="PointersAndMemory.pdf">sAndMemory.</a><a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/102/PointersAndMemory.pdf">pdf</a></h3>See also<ul><li>The silly <a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/104/">Binky Pointer Fun</a>&nbsp;video -- animated introduction to pointers</li><li><a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/105/">Linked List Problems</a> --lots of linked list problems</li><li><a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/110/">Binary Trees</a> -- all aboutbinary trees</li><li><a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/109/">The Great Tree List RecursionProblem</a> -- the greatest pointer/recursion problem ever (advanceed)</li></ul><p><br><a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/help.html">Downloading help<hr></a>Up to the<a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/">CS EducationLibrary Home</a></body></html>
